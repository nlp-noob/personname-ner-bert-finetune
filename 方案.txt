方案1，直接拼接对话:
Hi. Good to see u. How can I help u.  A love reading. Names dob both of you. Brandy Hall 8/4/1994 & Michael sosa don't know the birthday. Let me see. Are we going to be together? Are we going to be together? Yes. There will be good future. But. It will take time.  It will take time. He will take time. He having some issues. Few issues between both of you. Where I feel both of you should work. Do you know when he will come in contact with me.
方案可能出现的问题：
这种方式没有办法区分对话中，谁说了哪句话。而且这种方式篇幅很大，里面夹杂了很多没有用的信息。


方案2，在每个对话前面加入说话的人:
Healing Lady	:Hi. Healing Lady	:Hru. Healing Lady	:Good to see u. Healing Lady	:How can I help u. pi_709886593	:A love reading. Healing Lady	:Names dob both of you. pi_709886593	:Brandy Hall 8/4/1994 & Michael sosa don't know the birthday. Healing Lady	:Let me see. pi_709886593	:Are we going to be together?  Healing Lady	:Yes. Healing Lady	:There will be good future. Healing Lady	:But. Healing Lady	:It will take time. healing lady	:he will take time. Healing Lady	:He having some issues. Healing Lady	:Few issues between both of you . Healing Lady	:Where I feel both of you should work on. pi_709886593	:Do you know when he will come in contact with me.
方案可能出现的问题：
在聊天的过程中，用户名是可能会干扰模型的识别过程， 整个对话就只出现了很少次数的人名，似乎有许多没有用的信息，比如说Healing Lady机器人通常说很多话。

方案3、4，只取用户说的话以及机器人说的上面的1-2句话同样使用方案1和2的两种方法:
Healing Lady	:How can I help u. pi_709886593	:A love reading. Healing Lady	:Names dob both of you. pi_709886593	:Brandy Hall 8/4/1994 & Michael sosa don't know the birthday. Healing Lady	:Let me see. pi_709886593	:Are we going to be together? Healing Lady	:Yes. Healing Lady	:Where I feel both of you should work on. pi_709886593	:Do you know when he will come in contact with me.
方案可能出现的问题，大大减小了之前的篇幅，但是仍然可能因为上下文的干扰出现错误的识别。

方案5: 拆分成多个输入，只取用户的一句话和机器人的上下文：
    输入1: Healing Lady	:How can I help u. pi_709886593	:A love reading. Healing Lady	:Names dob both of you. Healing Lady	:Names dob both of you. 
    输入2: Healing Lady	:Names dob both of you.  pi_709886593	:Brandy Hall 8/4/1994 & Michael sosa don't know the birthday.Healing Lady	:Let me see.
    输入3: Healing Lady	:Let me see. pi_709886593	:Are we going to be together? Healing Lady	:Yes.
    输入4: Healing Lady	:Where I feel both of you should work on.pi_709886593	:Do you know when he will come in contact with me.

以上几种使用名字的方法都可能存在问题，用户的名字带有很大的不确定性，而名字除了表明这是个用户之外，就没有别的信息了，可以统一用user和robot代替，但是有一些人直接用名字当作用户名也是不可忽略的信息，所以前面的方案保留。


方案6、7、8（对应全部对话输入，拆分与不拆分):
Robot	:Hi. Robot	:Hru. Robot	:Good to see u. Robot	:How can I help u. User	:A love reading. Robot	:Names dob both of you. User	:Brandy Hall 8/4/1994 & Michael sosa don't know the birthday. Robot	:Let me see. User	:Are we going to be together?  Robot	:Yes. Robot	:There will be good future. Robot	:But. Robot	:It will take time. healing lady	:he will take time. Robot	:He having some issues. Robot	:Few issues between both of you . Robot	:Where I feel both of you should work on. User	:Do you know when he will come in contact with me.



方案9、10(拆分与不拆分)，只提取用户的话。
通常说名字的时候都是固定句式，比如说I'am xxx. My name is xxx.而且在测试一些模型的过程中发现对这种固定句式的判断还是比较准确的。这样子大大减小了篇幅，而且减少了误判名字到无关信息上的可能。（名字只会又用户说出口，标记只针对用户）。
A love reading.  Brandy Hall 8/4/1994 & Michael sosa don't know the birthday. Are we going to be together? Do you know when he will come in contact with me.
