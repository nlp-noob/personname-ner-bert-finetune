[USER]	:Because I am trying to get a peace of mind 
[ADVISOR]	:I wanted to tell you that you should not doubt anyone, you should trust him completely
[ADVISOR]	:Because trusting relationships are established
[USER]	:How ? 
[ADVISOR]	:The more you doubt your relationship, the weaker it becomes
[ADVISOR]	:And the more you trust your love and your relationship, the more you will love and be stronger.
